# Hackathon Sponsorship

### *THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS!*

## Welcome!
This repository contains detailed guides and starter templates for hackathon organizers to begin tackling the monstrosity that is hackathon sponsorship and finance.

It also contains slides and notes for my HackCon V workshop called _Hackathon Sponsorship: Bringing Your Budget to the Next Level_. [Here's my original talk proposal](https://www.papercall.io/talks/31513/children/31514).

## Using this Guide
This guide is intended for organizers of all levels - from total beginners to advanced organizers looking to pick up a couple new tricks.

This guide is free, open-source, and meant to be improved! Fork and star the repository, send me feedback (see the ```Contact Information``` section below), and feel free to make pull requests as you see fit.

## Directory Structure
In the root of this repository, you'll find this README, a comprehensive guide to hackathon sponsorship called _hackathon-sponsorship-guide.md_, and a master spreadsheet to help organize your sponsorship process as a whole called _sponsorship-spreadsheet.xlsx_. 

You'll also find my HackCon V workshop materials in the ```hackcon-v/``` directory, guides to sponsorship calls in the ```calls``` directory, guides and samples for sponsorship emails in the ```emails/``` folder, and budget and finance resources in the ```finance/``` directory. 

## Contributors
I couldn't have built this guide without the support of some other great organizers: Sam Pepose, Charlie Fei, and the rest of the VandyHacks Sponsorship Team.
